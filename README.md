For this CSS project, I will be creating an admin dashboard using CSS grid. 
From this project I learned:
1) How to use grid to position elements 
2) Differences between using grid vs using flexboxes
3) How to work with and use svg's. 
4) working with grid to create nested grids
5) How to build responsive websites using fractional units and repeat() instead of usinf media queries

I had a lot of fun making this dashboard. I hope you enjoy it too!
